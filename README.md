# MobFightPlugin_Count_disqualifiers
or events only, for version papaer 1.19.2. Ban gives 10 to the first ones to show they are disqualified. A good plugin for events that want to know who was disqualified first and that he will not return to the event, The plugin will only work in the world called mob_fighting, You need to use Multiverse-Core to add the world,
only by /pardon username can the ban be removed (recommended at the end of the event).
